This repo contains some fake "malware" to use against the CTF in its SSTI and SSRF Challenges.

This "malware" is actually **completely harmless**. It does **not** do anything malicious! But don't just take our word :wink: for it:

:microscope: Put on your lab coat and **reverse engineer the "malware"** to find out what it actually does!

:information_source: To clarify, you will _need to perform this task_ to be able to solve the SSTI and SSRF challenges.

:mask: Only use the files downloaded from this repository when a trustworthy _(sic!)_ Swag Store instance pointed you here!

:mag_right: For your own safety please take the time to verify the SHA-256 hashsum (and linked [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) report) of the file you are planning to use:
